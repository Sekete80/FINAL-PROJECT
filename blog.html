			<h3>Post 1: My Journey in C++</h3>
			<p>C++ has always been one of those programming languages that I wanted to master so bad. When I first started learning C++ I was scared and excited at the same time because rumours always said C++ is one of the hardest languages. But even under those circumstances I was eager to dive into it, especially since it is widely used in sysyems programming, game development, and performance criticals applications.<br> One of my first projects in C++ was a matrix calculator, which allowed me to perform operations like matrix addition, and multiplication. YES! It was a challenging because it wanted someone with a great understanding of multidimensional arrays and loops.</p>

			<h3>Post 2: Building My First HTML5 Game</h3>
			<p>Well when trying out this project, I was already in my 3rd year so I had a larger background knowledge on HTML5, and CSS.But on Javascript and Canvas i was not that perfect but i tried my best.So maybe 30% of this project was done by my friends who were better in Javascript.</p>

			<h3>Post 3: Building the Guessing Number Game in C++</h3>
			<p>When working on this project, I realised how the UK 49's and other powerball games are generated, because I used the random number generator which its output numbers are not known to anybody, not even the programmer who made it.So all in all I could say C++ has many applications in our real life . </p>
