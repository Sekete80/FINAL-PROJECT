		<h2>What I can Do</h2>
		<p>I was taught C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, Game Development.<br> But, I am more of a C++,HTML,CSS person as they are my biggest hobbies.<br> <br> <br> I will explain them in detail here:</p>
		<h2>C++</h2>
		<table>
		<td><img src="C++.jpeg"></td>
		<td><p>C++ is one of the most well-known and well-used programming languages today, used by more than four million programmers worldwide. The language made its debut in 1985 as an iteration of the C programming language. It began as an extension of C but evolved into a different language with distinctive characteristics and features.<br>

C++ is a scalable, object-oriented language, perfect for large, scalable applications thanks to its discrete and direct memory management capabilities and low-level machine functions. Additionally, C++ has the advantage of being both an object-oriented and a procedural language, something very few other languages can boast of.</p></td>

	<h2>HTML5</h2>
	<table>
		<td><img src="HTML5.png"></td>
		<td><p>HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It was the fifth and final major HTML version that is now a retired World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).<br>

HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML1 and even the DOM Level 2 HTML itself.</p></td>
	</table>
	<h2>CSS3</h2>
	<table>
		<td><img src="CSS3.png"></td>
		<td><p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>

CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p></td>
	</table>
	<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
	<table>
		<td><img src="JAVASCRIPT.png"></td>
		<td><p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to add interactivity to web pages. It's used to create dynamic content, such as animated graphics, pop-up menus, and clickable buttons. JavaScript is a key component of web development, along with HTML and CSS.</p></td>
